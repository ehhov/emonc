emonc - monitor connection and configuration helper
===================================================

emonc is a simple monitor connection and configuration helper 
implemented as a shell script. It obtains a list of monitors and 
performs a set of actions depending on the specified configuration.

It can
 - set the auto mode for all monitors and align them in one direction,
 - find the largest (by resolution) monitor and project it to all other 
   monitors or turn them off,
 - do the same using the primary monitor instead of the largest,
 - do the same using a specific monitor.
It can also wait for output change events (using the waitmonc program) 
and reconfigure monitors automatically. Output change events are, for 
example, monitor connection and disconnection and manual configuration 
(including setting a primary monitor).

Configuration rules include
 - monitor alignment direction and order,
 - per-monitor custom rotation rules,
 - user-defined configuration for specific monitors (which are not 
   affected by the global configuration after that).
You can specify everything using command line options, but it's easier 
to edit the emonc script and set defaults fitting your needs.

emonc can also be used to rotate monitors and set a primary monitor.


Dependencies
------------
To use emonc, only xrandr and sed are needed. To compile the waitmonc 
program, the Xlib and Xrandr libraries are needed.


Installation
